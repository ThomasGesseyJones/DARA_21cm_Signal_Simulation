        "\n",
        "Before we start we need to decide what type of 21-cm signal simulation we are going to create. Broadly speaking we can split 21-cm signal simulations into three categories:\n",
        "- Analytic (e.g.)\n",
        "- Full-numerical (e.g. )\n",
        "- Semi-numerical (e.g. )\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analytic** simulations typically operate by solving the differential equations that describe the 21-cm signal's evolution under the assumption of a homogeneous universe. So they treat the 21-cm signal $T_{\\rm 21}$ at a given redshift $z$ and all things it depends upon, such as the kinetic temperature $T_{\\rm K}$ and electron fraction $x_{\\rm e}$, as homogeneous throughout the entire universe. This has the advantage that for each of theese quantities at each redshift step you only need to store one number, and so it requires very little memory. In addition, because radiative transfer does not need to be modelled solving the differential equaitons is computaitonally easy, leading to very quick codes. Unfortunatley, the 21-cm signal is not uniform and assuming so means you cannot make predictions for the 21-cm power spectrum, and your predicitons of the global 21-cm signal are biased (#TODO ciation). \n",
        "\n",
        "**Full-numerical** simulations using particle-hydrodynamics codes to model the evolution of large portions of the universe. Physics often modelled includes, dark matter and baryons collapsing into halos under gravity, chemical and thermal evolution of the gas, star formation, and radiative transfer. As star formation occurs on much smaller scales (parsecs) than the cosmological volumes of interest (Megaparsecs or Gigaparsecs) these simulations require billions of particles to get sufficient resolution. Consequently, they are hugely computationally expensive. For example the CODA3 recently ran on the XX supercomputer taking... (#TODO citations). \n",
        "\n",
        "**Semi-numerical** simulations are somewhat of a compromise between the previous two. They aim to be physically realistic enougth to produce accurate predictions of the 21-cm signal, including its spatial variations, but fast and low-memory enougth to be run on a commerically available desktop computer. This is typically achieved by splitting the cosmological volume into simulation cells. Each cell can have a different temperature, ionization fraction, 21-cm signal, etc..., and hence allows for the variation in the signal to be modelled. Physics below the size of the cell, e.g. star formation, is not numerically modelled but instead treated using analytic approximations, while large scale physics that goes between cells, e.g. radiative transfer, is treated numerically. Hence, the name semi-numerical. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since, we want accurate enougth predictions in a reasonable time frame (ideally the hour length of this session) we shall develop a simple semi-numerical simulation code. "

Prior wisdom shows $L_{\\rm pix} = 3$ comoving Megaparsecs is a good choice for the latter value. In case, you haven't seen it before comoving lengths are distances that scale with the expansion of the universe. So 3 comoving Megaparsecs means the pixel would be 3 Megaparsecs large today, but it would have been 1.5 Megaparsecs in physical size at redshift $1$, when the universe was half its current size, and only 0.06 Megaparsecs at redshift $49$. We choose to have our cells be defined in comoving Megaparsecs so they, and our simulation box, scales automatically with the expansion of the universe. \n",
