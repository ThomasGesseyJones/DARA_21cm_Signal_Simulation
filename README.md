# DARA 21-cm Signal Simulation

## Overview

| DARA 21-cm Sim | A simple semi-numerical 21-cm signal simulation in a Jupyter notebook                                                                                                                                                   |

## Installation/Access Methods 

### Option 1
The simplest way to get your a copy of the workbook is to click either of the above *Open in Colab* links or the one 
at the top of the workbook (.ipyb file). 

### Option 2
You can also manually navigate to the link 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/ThomasGesseyJones/DARA_21cm_Signal_Simulation/blob/main/DARA_21cm_Signal_Simulation.ipynb

### Option 3

Open Google Colab, and when presented with the workbook selection pop-up window pick the GitHub tab. Then type into the 
search box *ThomasGesseyJones/DARA* it should automatically find the workbook and list it underneath 'Path'. Simply
click on the workbook name and it will open a copy of the workbook. 

### Option Avoiding Google Colab

Note for the DARA workshop it is recommended you use Google Colab since that way we don't have to worry about hardware
requirements or any potential OS/version incompatibilities. 

If you do not wish to use Google Colab, the workbook can be directly downloaded from this repository using `git clone` 
or as a zip file by selecting the latest release. The `.ipyb` notebook file can then be opened in an interactive Jupyter 
notebook environment of your choice. 

For more information on how to get *Jupyter* running on your machine see

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the organizers of the [2023 DARA Global 21-cm Astronomy Workshop](https://www.sarao.ac.za/news/student-workshop-on-global-21cm-astronomy-experiments-and-technology-to-be-held-in-february-2023/)
for giving me the opportunity to present, and 
finally giving me the motivation to make this workbook, something I have wanted to do for some time. 

The structure of this code is inspired by the private 21-cm signal simulation code developed over many years by 
[Anastasia Fialkov](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/people/Anastasia.Fialkov), 
[Rennan Barkana](http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~barkana/), 
[Itamar Reis](https://github.com/ireis) and others who have my sincerest thanks for giving me 
access to said code 
and teaching me how to use and extend it. Several of the equations that are used have been modified from the original 
[21-cm FAST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3878), which remains an excellent more technical introduction to 21-cm signal 
simulations. 

Finally, I would like to thank [Christian Kirkham](https://beta-decay.github.io/) for his testing of this workbook and his invaluable feedback. 

If you have any feedback on the workbook or would like to contribute to it feel free to contact me at tg400@cam.ac.uk 
or open a pull request on the Github repository where this workbook is hosted.
